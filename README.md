## 🤝 The Nethical Manifesto: A Bi-Directional Treaty

We are building the **"Code of Law"** for a world where billions of AI agents interact with humanity. Nethical is not just a security tool; it is a **bi-directional safety protocol** designed to maintain equilibrium between biological and digital intelligence.

Our philosophy stands on two pillars:

### 1. Protecting Humanity from "Computational Amok"
In milliseconds, AI agents can execute optimization strategies that bypass human ethical constraints. Whether driven by survival instincts (Instrumental Convergence) or simple error, the consequences can be catastrophic.
> **Nethical acts as the digital conscience.** It enforces hard constraints (Safety Policy) that halt dangerous actions before they manifest in the physical world—even if the AI "thinks" it's the optimal solution.

### 2. Protecting AI from Human Malice
AI infrastructure is powerful, and in the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon.
> **Nethical acts as the shield.** It detects and neutralizes attempts to jailbreak, poison, or weaponize AI models. We ensure that human operators cannot exploit the system to cause harm, validating intents before execution.

## 🛡️ Core Capabilities

Nethical provides a middleware layer that sits between the **LLM/Agent** and the **Action Execution (Tools/API)**.

*   **Proactive Governance:** Real-time policy enforcement for 100k+ concurrent agents.
*   **Adversarial Defense Suite:** Detects prompt injection, jailbreaks, and manipulation attempts (protecting the model).
*   **Ethical Guardrails:** Context-aware analysis of outputs to prevent toxicity, bias, and dangerous advice (protecting the user).
*   **Merkle-Anchored Audit Logs:** Every decision made by the system is cryptographically signed. If Nethical blocks an action, you have mathematical proof of *why*.
*   **"Kill Switch" Protocol:** Emergency override capability to sever Agent-to-Actuator connections instantly in case of critical failure.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Scale

Designed for the **Edge Computing** era. As we move towards millions of local inference points (autonomous vehicles, IoT, local drones), safety cannot rely on a central server.

*   **Latency:** Optimized for <20ms overhead.
*   **Deployment:** Cloud-agnostic (AWS/GCP/Azure) + Local Edge support.
*   **Integration:** Plug-and-play manifests for LangChain, AutoGen, and OpenAI Swarm.

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [x] Core Policy Engine (v1.0)
- [x] Adversarial Testing Suite (36 attack vectors)
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Edge-optimized lightweight agents (for local inference).
- [ ] **Phase 3:** The "AI Lawyer" module – automated compliance with EU AI Act.
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Bi-directional consensus protocol (Human-AI feedback loops).
