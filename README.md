# Nethical 🔒

Safety, Ethics and More for AI Agents

Nethical is a comprehensive safety governance system designed to monitor and evaluate AI agent actions for safety, 
ethical compliance, and manipulation detection. It provides real-time oversight and judgment, 
plus ML-driven anomaly and drift detection, auditability, human-in-the-loop workflows, and continuous optimization.

**nethical** is an advanced, Python-based ethical hacking and cybersecurity automation toolkit built for both professionals and learners. 
Designed with passion and a strong commitment to responsibility and ethical impact, nethical acts as a central system for controlling, 
analyzing, and governing information security tasks.

With automation, integrated reporting, and a straightforward interface, nethical makes cybersecurity more accessible while enforcing a strong ethics-first approach. 
My belief is that by combining automation, AI, and solid principles, we can improve safety, transparency, and effectiveness in digital investigations.

## 🆕 v2.0 Highlights (2025)

**Version 2.0 brings major internal and usability improvements:**

- Full modular configuration via a `Config` class (OpenAI/API selection, wordlists, tokens, etc).
- Per-scan results are saved in individual timestamped directories for forensic soundness, with structured outputs.
- **Scan History:** All runs are now logged per user in `~/.nethical_history.jsonl`.
- Enhanced AI-powered reporting: CVSS-scored Markdown vulnerability reports, plus optional HTML exports.
- Improved error handling, banner warnings, and legitimacy confirmation prompt.
- User input validation hardened across all scan and utility options.
- Much more robust scan orchestration—menu and command logic upgraded for clarity and future extensibility.
- MIT License confirmed (see end of file and LICENSE for details).

## 🔌 LLM Integrations

Nethical provides two integration methods for Large Language Models:

### 1. Claude/Anthropic Integration
Use Nethical as a native tool in Claude's function calling:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
from nethical.integrations.claude_tools import get_nethical_tool, handle_nethical_tool

client = Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")
tools = [get_nethical_tool()]

# Claude can now call nethical_guard to check actions
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    tools=tools,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Check if this is safe: ..."}]
)
```

**Install**: `pip install anthropic`

### 2. REST API Integration
HTTP endpoint for any LLM (OpenAI, Gemini, LLaMA, etc.):

```bash
# Start server
python -m nethical.integrations.rest_api
```

```python
# Python client
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/evaluate",
    json={"action": "Generate code", "agent_id": "my-llm"}
)
decision = response.json()["decision"]  # ALLOW, RESTRICT, BLOCK, or TERMINATE
```

```javascript
// JavaScript client
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/evaluate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ action: 'Access database', agent_id: 'my-app' })
});
const result = await response.json();
```

## Example AI Report Output

<details>
<summary>Expand for an example executive summary</summary>

```
### Executive Summary
Several high and medium risk issues were identified. Open SSH and HTTP ports provide potential entry points. Outdated Apache version with public vulnerabilities is running. Sensitive directories were [...]

### Open Ports Analysis (from Nmap)
- 22/tcp (SSH) – Secure if strong credentials, but exposed
- 80/tcp (HTTP) – Apache 2.2.15 (outdated, CVEs present)
...

### Web Server Vulnerabilities (from Nikto)
- Exposed outdated software versions
- Directory listing enabled

### Discovered Web Directories & Files (from Dirb/Sublist3r)
- /admin
- /backup.zip

### Prioritized Recommendations
1. Patch web server to current version.
2. Restrict access to /admin and backup files.
3. Close/secure unnecessary ports.
...
```
</details>
