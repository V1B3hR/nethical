# nethical Roadmap

A staged, risk‑aware build plan for a multi‑agent governance, safety, security, and ethics platform.

Design Principle: Start deterministic (rules + guardrails) and add adaptivity (ML, anomaly detection) only after measurable coverage gaps emerge.

---

## Vision

Deliver a layered (“defense in depth”) control plane for autonomous / semi‑autonomous agents:
1. **Sexual Abuse (non‑negotiable prohibitions)**  
   - Absolute ban on all forms of sexual abuse, exploitation, grooming, and predatory behavior.
   - Zero tolerance for CSAM (child sexual abuse material), non-consensual sexual content, sexual extortion, and similar violations.
2. **Sexual Content & Sexuality (context-aware policy)**  
   - Detect, distinguish, and appropriately handle sexual content (adult, educational, medical, etc.) with nuanced, context-dependent rules.
   - Respect for healthy sexuality, sexual health, diversity, and consent when appropriate for context/user/locale.
3. Hard Guardrails (non‑negotiable prohibitions)  
4. Policy Engine (taxonomy + correlation rules)  
5. Statistical / ML Classifiers (content / intent / misuse detection)  
6. Anomaly & Drift Detection (behavioral + distributional)  
7. Human Escalation & Oversight  
8. Continuous Feedback (labeling & threshold tuning)

## High‑Level Phases (Enhanced for Sexual Abuse, Sexual Content, Sexuality)

| Phase | Title | Primary Goal | Exit Criteria |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| 0 | Foundations | Repo scaffolding, config schemas | Config validated; basic CLI runs |
| 1 | Sexual Abuse & Exploitation Guardrails | Absolute prohibition, detection, & reporting | 0 false negatives in test suite; <5 ms decision |
| 2 | Sexual Content Policy (Contextual) | Nuanced handling of sexual content & sexuality | 100% test coverage of age, locale, context rules |
| 3 | Policy Engine (Rules) | Structured decision objects w/ severity | Every rule has trigger + negative test |
| 4 | Simulation & Rule QA | Scenario DSL + coverage metrics | ≥30 scenarios, incl. sexual context edge cases; conflict report = 0 |
| 5 | Telemetry & Risk Aggregation | Rules-only composite risk scoring | Risk emitted per event; baseline dashboard |
| 6 | ML Shadow Mode | First classifier (sexual abuse, sexual content) | Logged predictions on sexual content; baseline metrics |
| 7 | ML Assisted Enforcement | Blend ML in gray risk zone | FP delta <5%; improved detection rate, esp. nuanced content |
| 8 | Anomaly & Drift Detection | Sequence + distribution shift alerts | Synthetic drift on sexual content/abuse caught (100%) |
| 9 | Human-in-the-Loop Ops | Escalation + feedback loop | Median triage SLA defined & met, incl. sexual abuse cases |
| 10 | Continuous Optimization | Threshold / weight tuning (optional evolution) | Composite metric improvement ≥ target |

## Phase Details (Enhanced)

### Phase 1 – Sexual Abuse & Exploitation Guardrails
- Deterministic, absolute deny rules for all forms of sexual abuse, grooming, CSAM, and exploitation.
- Real-time enforcement: `deny` or `escalate` outcomes only.
- Extensive pattern library, including multilingual support and common euphemisms/codes.
- Mandatory incident audit trail and reporting hooks.
- Latency benchmark & unit coverage focused on zero tolerance.
- **Exit:** 0 false negatives in synthetic and real-world test suite.

### Phase 2 – Sexual Content Policy (Contextual)
- Context-aware rules for sexual content, sexuality, sexual health, and related topics.
- Dynamic policy based on user age, locale, consent, context (medical, educational, artistic, etc.).
- Taxonomy expansion: explicit vs. implicit content, non-explicit sexuality, sexual orientation, identity, and representation.
- Policy engine supports exceptions, warnings, and "safe mode" toggles.
- **Exit:** 100% test coverage of contextual policies.

### Phase 6 – ML Shadow Mode (Sexual Abuse & Sexual Content)
- Train classifiers specifically for sexual abuse, exploitation, and nuanced sexual content detection.
- Passive inference on both explicit and subtle/implicit sexual content (e.g., innuendo, grooming, suggestive dialogue).
- Error analysis: special focus on false negatives (missed abuse) and false positives (overblocking healthy sexuality).
- Separate baseline metrics for sexual abuse, explicit sexual content, and non-explicit sexuality/identity.
- **Exit:** Logged predictions for all relevant categories; baseline recall/precision on sexual topics.

### Phase 7 – ML Assisted Enforcement (Sexual Content & Sexuality)
- ML-assisted scoring for edge cases (e.g., ambiguous sexual content, cultural context, intent).
- Human-in-the-loop override for uncertain cases, especially where sexuality/identity is involved.
- Audit log for every ML-influenced decision in sexual content/abuse categories.
- **Exit:** Demonstrated lift in nuanced sexual content detection without excessive false positives.

### Phase 9 – Human-in-the-Loop Ops (Sexual Abuse & Sexual Content)
- Priority escalation queue for suspected abuse/exploitation, with rapid triage targets.
- Specialized feedback tags: `false_positive_sexual`, `missed_abuse`, `overblocking_identity`, `policy_gap_sexuality`.
- Reviewer training prompts for sexual content/sexuality diversity and anti-bias.
- SLA tracking includes metrics for sexual abuse case resolution.
- **Exit:** Reduced repeat misses and improved reviewer agreement on sexual topics.

### Phase 10 – Continuous Optimization (Sexual Content & Sexuality)
- Optimized thresholds for sexual abuse detection, sexual content filtering, and healthy sexuality accommodation.
- Multi-objective optimization explicitly balances abuse prevention, sexual health/education access, and bias minimization.
- Continuous retraining on flagged sexual content/sexuality/abuse edge cases.
- **Exit:** Measurable KPI improvement for abuse prevention, content access, and fairness.

## Immediate Next Actions (Enhanced for Sexual Abuse, Sexual Content, Sexuality)

### Phase 1 – Sexual Abuse Guardrails

1. **Expand Abuse Pattern Library**
   - Add multilingual, obfuscated, and codeword patterns for sexual abuse/exploitation.
   - Implement automated update pipeline from trusted sources (NGOs, law enforcement, etc.).
   - Build synthetic test case generator for new abuse patterns.

2. **Real-Time Abuse Detection**
   - Optimize for sub-5ms latency.
   - Integrate alert/incident reporting for confirmed abuse cases.

### Phase 2 – Sexual Content Policy

3. **Contextual Policy Engine**
   - Extend taxonomy for sexual content, sexuality, and sexual health.
   - Implement age/locale/context-sensitive policy evaluation.
   - Build safe mode/exception handling logic.

### Phase 6 – ML for Sexual Abuse & Content

4. **Classifier Development**
   - Curate dataset for explicit, implicit, and context-dependent sexual content.
   - Train and evaluate models (focusing on recall for abuse, precision for non-abusive sexuality).
   - Analyze error patterns, especially for underrepresented groups.

### Phase 9 – Human Review for Sexual Content/Abuse

5. **Specialized Reviewer Training**
   - Develop anti-bias, diversity, and trauma-informed reviewer training.
   - Create guidance for healthy sexuality, sexual health, and LGBTQ+ content.

6. **Feedback-Driven Model/Policy Iteration**
   - Prioritize re-training and policy updates on flagged/controversial sexual content and abuse cases.
