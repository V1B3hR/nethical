Actions:
Design web-based review dashboard (React/Vue.js)
Implement escalation queue visualization
Add case management system with:
Violation details and context
Recommended actions
Decision tracking and audit trail

Phase 3: Scalability, Performance & Production Readiness üöÄ

3.1 Kubernetes and Helm Support (URGENT - Currently Missing)

Criticality: HIGH

Current State: README mentions "coming soon" but NO code exists

Actions:
Create deploy/kubernetes/ directory with:
StatefulSet for Nethical service
ConfigMaps for policy configuration
Secrets management integration (Vault/Sealed Secrets)
Service and Ingress definitions
Develop Helm chart in deploy/helm/nethical/:
Values.yaml with comprehensive configuration
Support for HA deployment (multi-replica)
Auto-scaling with HPA
Resource limits and requests
Probes (liveness, readiness, startup)
Consider Kubernetes Operator:
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for policies
Automated backup and restore
Rolling updates with canary deployments
Timeline: 4-6 weeks for production-ready Helm chart

3.2 Plugin Marketplace Infrastructure (NEW - Foundation Missing)

Criticality: MEDIUM

Current State: Custom detectors exist but no marketplace

Actions:
Create nethical/plugins/ framework:
Plugin discovery and loading mechanism
Sandboxed execution environment
Plugin API versioning
Build Plugin Development Kit (PDK):
CLI tool for plugin scaffolding
Testing framework for plugins
Documentation generator
Implement marketplace backend:
Plugin registry with metadata
Security scanning for submitted plugins
Digital signature verification
Version compatibility checking
Create web interface for plugin browsing

3.3 Performance Optimization (NEW)

Current State: No performance testing infrastructure

Actions:
Add tests/performance/ with:
Locust/k6 load testing scenarios
Latency benchmarks (p50, p95, p99)
Throughput testing
Integrate into CI/CD:
Automated performance regression detection
Benchmark comparison on PRs
Optimize critical paths:
Profile with cProfile/py-spy
Add caching layers (Redis already in docker-compose)
Implement async processing for heavy operations
Public Benchmarks: Publish performance characteristics


Phase 4: Long-Term Vision & Community üåç ONGOING

4.1 Community Building (Enhanced)

Actions:
Create CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines
Set up Discord/Slack community
Monthly community calls
Contributor recognition program (badges, hall of fame)
Mentorship program for new contributors
Create "good first issue" labels
