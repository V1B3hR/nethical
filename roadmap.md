Actions:
Integrate threat modeling tools (Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon)
Create GitHub Action to update threat model on PR changes
Add threat model validation to CI/CD pipeline
Implement automated security control verification
Metrics: Coverage percentage, controls-to-threats mapping

1.3 Enhance Supply Chain Security (Refine Existing)

Current State: Good foundation with SBOM and signing

Actions:
Add dependency pinning and hash verification
Implement dependabot.yml with automated PR creation
Create supply chain security dashboard
Add SLSA Level 3+ compliance tracking

1.4 Complete Authentication System (NEW)

Criticality: HIGH

Gap: Threat model mentions "Agent ID validation - Partial"

Actions:
Implement JWT-based API authentication
Add API key management system
Support for SSO/SAML integration
Multi-factor authentication for admin operations

Phase 2: Mature Ethical and Safety Framework üõ°Ô∏è

2.1 Enhance Ethical Taxonomy (Build on Existing)

Current State: Well-implemented in ethical_taxonomy.py

Improvements:
Expand taxonomy coverage beyond current dimensions (privacy, manipulation, fairness, safety)
Add industry-specific taxonomies (healthcare, finance, education)
Create taxonomy validation API endpoint
Publish taxonomy as versioned JSON schema
Community Collaboration: Host taxonomy workshop, create RFC process

2.2 Build Human-in-the-Loop Interface (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)

Criticality: MEDIUM-HIGH

Current State: Backend exists, no interface

Actions:
Design web-based review dashboard (React/Vue.js)
Implement escalation queue visualization
Add case management system with:
Violation details and context
Recommended actions
Decision tracking and audit trail
Create reviewer training module
Build feedback loop to ML models

2.3 Implement Explainable AI Layer (NEW)
Criticality: MEDIUM
Actions:
Integrate SHAP/LIME for ML model explanations
Create decision tree visualization for policy engine
Add "explain this decision" API endpoint
Generate natural language explanations for violations
Build transparency report generator

2.4 Formalize Policy Language (Enhance Existing)

Current State: Two policy engines exist - consolidate or clarify usage

Actions:
Choose canonical policy engine or document use cases for each
Create formal grammar specification (EBNF)
Build policy validator and linter
Implement policy simulation/dry-run mode
Add policy impact analysis before deployment


Phase 3: Scalability, Performance & Production Readiness üöÄ

3.1 Kubernetes and Helm Support (URGENT - Currently Missing)

Criticality: HIGH

Current State: README mentions "coming soon" but NO code exists

Actions:
Create deploy/kubernetes/ directory with:
StatefulSet for Nethical service
ConfigMaps for policy configuration
Secrets management integration (Vault/Sealed Secrets)
Service and Ingress definitions
Develop Helm chart in deploy/helm/nethical/:
Values.yaml with comprehensive configuration
Support for HA deployment (multi-replica)
Auto-scaling with HPA
Resource limits and requests
Probes (liveness, readiness, startup)
Consider Kubernetes Operator:
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for policies
Automated backup and restore
Rolling updates with canary deployments
Timeline: 4-6 weeks for production-ready Helm chart

3.2 Plugin Marketplace Infrastructure (NEW - Foundation Missing)

Criticality: MEDIUM

Current State: Custom detectors exist but no marketplace

Actions:
Create nethical/plugins/ framework:
Plugin discovery and loading mechanism
Sandboxed execution environment
Plugin API versioning
Build Plugin Development Kit (PDK):
CLI tool for plugin scaffolding
Testing framework for plugins
Documentation generator
Implement marketplace backend:
Plugin registry with metadata
Security scanning for submitted plugins
Digital signature verification
Version compatibility checking
Create web interface for plugin browsing

3.3 Performance Optimization (NEW)

Current State: No performance testing infrastructure

Actions:
Add tests/performance/ with:
Locust/k6 load testing scenarios
Latency benchmarks (p50, p95, p99)
Throughput testing
Integrate into CI/CD:
Automated performance regression detection
Benchmark comparison on PRs
Optimize critical paths:
Profile with cProfile/py-spy
Add caching layers (Redis already in docker-compose)
Implement async processing for heavy operations
Public Benchmarks: Publish performance characteristics


Phase 4: Long-Term Vision & Community üåç ONGOING

4.1 Community Building (Enhanced)

Actions:
Create CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines
Set up Discord/Slack community
Monthly community calls
Contributor recognition program (badges, hall of fame)
Mentorship program for new contributors
Create "good first issue" labels

4.2 Governance Model (NEW)

Actions:
Establish Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
Document decision-making process
Create roadmap RFC process
Adopt comprehensive Code of Conduct
Define maintainer responsibilities

4.3 Research and Innovation (Enhanced)
Actions:
Partner with academic institutions
Create experimental features branch
Publish research papers on AI governance
Host annual conference/symposium
Establish bug bounty program
