"""
Nethical Hooks â€” Interfaces

This module defines narrow, security-focused extension points for attestation,
cryptographic role signaling, communications policy, geofencing, offline
persistence, and jurisdiction-aware authorization.

Design goals:
- Minimal, explicit, and composable interfaces
- Structural typing with runtime checkability for plugin validation
- Immutability and stable return shapes
- Compatibility with high-assurance and zero-trust environments
