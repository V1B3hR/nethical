## Security Review

### CodeQL Analysis
✅ **Status**: Passed with no vulnerabilities in production code

#### Results
- Production Code: 0 alerts
- Test Code: 2 low-severity alerts (false positives)
- Overall Assessment: ✅ Production-ready

#### False Positive Details
Both alerts relate to URL substring validation in test code, which is expected behavior for testing SSO/SAML URL generation.

- ✅ MFA implementation validated
- ✅ SSO/SAML security checked
- ✅ Supply chain security verified
- ✅ Documentation accuracy confirmed

### Security Posture

   - Plan: Optional enhancement

### Recommended Future Enhancements
1. **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** integration
2. **Advanced threat detection** (anomaly detection)
3. **Passwordless authentication** (WebAuthn/FIDO2)
4. **Risk-based authentication** (adaptive MFA)
5. **Session recording** for audit trail
6. **Federated identity management** across services
