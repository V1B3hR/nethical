# This file is auto-generated by pip-compile with --generate-hashes.
# Do NOT edit by hand. CI will regenerate and keep it in sync with requirements.txt.
#
# To generate locally:
#   python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip-tools
#   pip-compile --generate-hashes --output-file requirements-hashed.txt requirements.txt
#
# The first CI run after updating requirements.txt will populate this file if drift is detected.
