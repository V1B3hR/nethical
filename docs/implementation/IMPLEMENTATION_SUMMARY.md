# Implementation Summary: End-to-End Real Data Training

## Overview

This implementation adds a complete end-to-end training orchestrator that downloads, processes, and trains the BaselineMLClassifier using real-world security datasets from Kaggle.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Infrastructure (`scripts/baseline_orchestrator.py`)

A unified orchestrator script that:
- Downloads datasets from Kaggle (with API support)
- Processes each dataset with dedicated processors
- Merges all processed data into `processed_train_data.json`
- Trains the BaselineMLClassifier
- Evaluates and saves the trained model

**Usage:**
```bash
# Full pipeline
python scripts/baseline_orchestrator.py

# Step-by-step
python scripts/baseline_orchestrator.py --download
python scripts/baseline_orchestrator.py --process-only
python scripts/baseline_orchestrator.py --train-only
```

### 2. Dataset Processors (`scripts/dataset_processors/`)

Three specialized processors for different dataset types:

#### BaseProcessor (`base_processor.py`)
- Common utilities for all processors
- CSV loading with encoding detection
- Feature normalization
- Standard interface for processing

#### CyberSecurityAttacksProcessor (`cyber_security_processor.py`)
- Processes network attack datasets
- Maps attack types, severity, anomaly scores to features
- Handles common security dataset fields

#### MicrosoftSecurityProcessor (`microsoft_security_processor.py`)
- Processes Microsoft incident prediction datasets
- Maps incident grades, severity levels to features
- Handles Microsoft-specific fields

#### GenericSecurityProcessor (`generic_processor.py`)
- Processes any security dataset using heuristics
- Automatically identifies relevant fields
- Fallback for unknown dataset formats

### 3. Standard Feature Mapping

All datasets are normalized to these features:

| Feature | Description | Range |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `violation_count` | Number/frequency of violations | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| `severity_max` | Maximum severity level | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| `recency_score` | How recent the event is | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| `frequency_score` | Frequency of similar events | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| `context_risk` | Contextual risk factors | 0.0 - 1.0 |

### 4. Refactored Baseline Classifier

Updated `nethical/mlops/baseline.py`:
- Removed inline training script
- Now serves as a pure classifier module
- Can be imported and used by orchestrator
- Maintains all training, prediction, and evaluation methods

### 5. Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation:
- Updated `README.md` with training pipeline section
- Enhanced `scripts/README.md` with orchestrator details
- Created `docs/TRAINING_GUIDE.md` quick reference
- Added inline documentation in all processors

### 6. Tests

Comprehensive test coverage:

#### `tests/test_dataset_processors.py`
- Tests all three processor types
- Verifies feature extraction
- Validates label mapping
- Ensures output format consistency

#### `tests/test_end_to_end_pipeline.py`
- Integration test for complete workflow
- Creates sample datasets
- Processes and merges data
- Trains and evaluates model
- Tests model save/load

### 7. Demo

Created `examples/training/real_data_training_demo.py`:
- Demonstrates the complete pipeline
- Shows setup instructions
- Provides usage examples
- Explains next steps

## Datasets Used

The pipeline supports all datasets listed in `datasets/datasets`:

1. Cyber Security Attacks
2. Microsoft Security Incident Prediction
3. Data Ethics in Data Science
4. Security Breach Dataset
5. Cybersecurity Imagery Dataset
6. RBA Dataset
7. AI Report discussions
8. General discussions
9. Philosophy CSV discussion

## Output Structure

```
processed_train_data.json              # Merged training data
data/
  external/                            # Downloaded CSV files (gitignored)
    *.csv
  processed/                           # Processed datasets (gitignored)
    cyber_security_attacks_processed.json
    microsoft_security_processed.json
    ...
models/
  candidates/
    baseline_model.json                # Trained model (gitignored)
    baseline_metrics.json              # Validation metrics (gitignored)
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: Download
```bash
python scripts/baseline_orchestrator.py --download
```
- Reads dataset URLs from `datasets/datasets`
- Uses Kaggle API to download (if configured)
- Falls back to manual download instructions
- Saves to `data/external/`

### Step 2: Process
```bash
python scripts/baseline_orchestrator.py --process-only
```
- Scans `data/external/` for CSV files
- Chooses appropriate processor based on filename
- Maps fields to standard features
- Extracts binary labels (0 = benign, 1 = malicious)
- Saves to `data/processed/`

### Step 3: Merge
- Loads all processed JSON files
- Combines into single dataset
- Shuffles records
- Saves to `processed_train_data.json`

### Step 4: Train
```bash
python scripts/baseline_orchestrator.py --train-only
```
- Loads merged dataset
- Splits 80/20 train/validation
- Trains BaselineMLClassifier
- Evaluates on validation set
- Saves model and metrics

## Example Output

## Integration with Existing Code

The implementation integrates seamlessly with existing Nethical components:

- **Phase 5 (Shadow Mode)**: Trained models can be used for passive predictions
- **Phase 6 (Blended Enforcement)**: Models can assist with gray-zone decisions
- **Phase 7 (Anomaly Detection)**: Models provide baseline for drift detection
- **Training Pipeline**: Compatible with `scripts/train_model.py`
- **Testing Pipeline**: Works with `scripts/test_model.py`

## Next Steps

After running the pipeline:

1. **Review Metrics**: Check `baseline_metrics.json` for validation results
2. **Test Model**: Run `scripts/test_model.py` for comprehensive evaluation
3. **Deploy to Shadow**: Use in Phase 5 for passive monitoring
4. **Promote to Blended**: Enable in Phase 6 for active decisions
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track with Phase 7 anomaly detection
6. **Collect Feedback**: Gather human labels for continuous improvement
7. **Retrain**: Use `--train-only` to update model with new data
