# Contributing to Nethical

## The "Sapper Mindset"
This is not a typical web app. A bug here doesn't just crash a browser; it could allow an AI agent to bypass safety protocols in critical infrastructure.

When contributing code, please adopt the **Sapper Mindset**:
1.  **Assume Failure:** What happens if the AI tries to bypass your check?
2.  **Verify Everything:** Trust no input, neither from the human nor the model.
3.  **Test for Malice:** Use our Adversarial Suite to attack your own code before submitting.

We welcome all contributions that help secure the Human-AI future!
