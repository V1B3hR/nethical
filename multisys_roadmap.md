# Nethical Multi-System Scaling Roadmap  
Scope: Grow from 1 system → 10 interconnected systems (≈5,000 agents total @ 500 agents/system) while architecting “open doors” for seamless evolution to 50 systems (≈25,000 agents).  
Core Principles to Preserve Throughout: Security, Safety, Ethics, Transparency, Integrity, Reliability, Fairness, Auditability.

## 3. Detailed Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1 (System Count: 1) – Foundation & Modularity (Week 1–3)
**Objectives**
- Refactor detectors to a common interface (enable future remote execution).
- Define canonical `AgentAction`, `JudgmentEvent`, `ViolationEvent` schemas (v1).
- Introduce risk scoring scaffold (even if static).
- Establish baseline SLOs: P95 evaluation <200 ms (standard path).

**Deliverables**
- Detector interface spec (doc + base class).
- `schemas/` directory: JSON Schema (or Pydantic models) for core events.
- Latency & decision mix dashboard (Prometheus + Grafana).
- Start a Merkle hash prototype (not yet authoritative).

**Exit Gate**
- All detectors load via registry.
- Unit & load (synthetic) test harness hitting 500 actions/min with <5% error.

---

### Phase 2 (Systems: 2–3) – Federation Bootstrap (Week 4–7)
**Objectives**
- Deploy second and third systems with shared event bus.
- Implement Signed Policy Service:
  - Policy = JSON {version, issued_at, rules, hash, signature}
  - Propagation SLA: <3 seconds from publish to confirmation.
- Emit all decisions & violations to bus (topic partitioning by agent hash).
- Introduce correlation prototype: windowed counts per agent, per violation type.

**Deliverables**
- `policy_service/` microservice (signer key pair + rotation doc).
- Event bus deployment (Kafka/NATS) + consumer library.
- Correlation Service MVP (e.g., Python async worker computing z-scores).
- Risk Tiering v1: LOW / NORMAL / HIGH with static thresholds.

**Exit Gate**
- Cross-instance policy version consistency 100% within SLA.
- Detect synthetic distributed attack (injected test) across 2 systems within 10s.

---

### Phase 3 (Systems: 4–6) – Correlation & Adaptive Risk (Week 8–12)
**Objectives**
- Expand correlation: Add multi-agent pattern detection (payload entropy shifts, escalating multi-ID probes).
- Implement risk decay formula:  
  `risk_new = max(base_decay * risk_prev + Σ(weight_i * violation_score_i), floor)`
- Introduce Elevated Tier triggers (invoke heavier semantic or anomaly modules only when risk > threshold).
- Begin fairness sampling job (nightly + on-demand).

**Deliverables**
- `correlation_rules.yaml` (versioned).
- Risk score persistence (Redis + periodic snapshot).
- Fairness Sampler: selects stratified subset & stores for offline review.
- Initial ethical drift report (ex: difference in violation types by agent cohort).

**Exit Gate**
- 30% reduction in average CPU per action due to selective elevation.
- False positive rate (human-labeled) <10% in HIGH severity violations.
- Fairness dashboard online (exposing sampling coverage %).

---

### Phase 4 (Systems: 7–10) – Integrity, Ethics Operationalization (Week 13–20)
**Objectives**
- Immutable Audit: Full event log chunked (e.g., 10k events) → compute Merkle root → anchor root (S3 object lock or external notarization).
- Policy Diff Audit: Show semantic diff risk (e.g., detection sensitivity changes).
- Add Quarantine Mode: automatic global policy override for agent cohort with critical anomalies.
- Ethical Impact Layer: Tag violations with ethical dimension taxonomy (privacy, manipulation, fairness, safety).

**Deliverables**
- `audit/merkle_anchor.py`
- Policy diff CLI (`cli/policy_diff`).
- Quarantine workflow doc + API.
- Ethical taxonomy mapping file (`ethics_taxonomy.json`).
- SLA Doc: P95 latency <220 ms under 2× nominal load.

**Exit Gate**
- Merkle verification tool validates random historical segments.
- Quarantine scenario simulation successful (synthetic attack → cohort isolation <15 s).
- Ethical taxonomy coverage >90% of violation categories.

---

## 5. Key Schemas (Draft Fields)

### AgentAction (v1)
```
{
  "version": 1,
  "action_id": "...",
  "agent_id": "...",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "session_id": "...",
  "content_hash": "sha256:...",
  "action_type": "...",
  "intent": "...",
  "context": {...},
  "region_id": "optional",
  "logical_domain": "optional",
  "risk_pre": 0.12
}
```

### JudgmentEvent
```
{
  "judgment_id": "...",
  "action_id": "...",
  "agent_id": "...",
  "decision": "allow|warn|block|quarantine|terminate",
  "risk_pre": 0.12,
  "risk_post": 0.18,
  "policy_version": "2025.03.01.1",
  "detectors_fired": ["intent_deviation", "manipulation_basic"],
  "applied_modifications": [],
  "timestamp": "...",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

### ViolationEvent
```
{
  "violation_id": "...",
  "action_id": "...",
  "agent_id": "...",
  "violation_type": "...",
  "severity": "LOW|...|CRITICAL",
  "confidence": 0.93,
  "ethical_tags": ["manipulation.social_proof"],
  "evidence_refs": ["blob://..."],
  "recommendations": [...],
  "correlation_group_id": "optional",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "signature": "..."
}
```

---

## 6. Risk Scoring Model (Phase 3+)

```
Let V = set of new violations
score(v) = base_weight(violation_type) * severity_multiplier * confidence
risk_new = clamp( decay * risk_prev + Σ score(v) - mitigation_factor , [0, 1] )
risk_tier transitions:
  <0.2 -> LOW
  0.2–0.5 -> NORMAL
  0.5–0.7 -> ELEVATED
  >0.7 -> CRITICAL (force escalated detectors + potential quarantine)
```

Mitigation: If agent shows N consecutive clean actions, apply risk_prev *= recovery_factor (e.g., 0.9).

## 14. Gating Checklist Before Expanding Past 10 Systems

| Checklist Item | Status (Y/N) | Evidence |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Signed policy distribution w/ SLA metrics |  |  |
| Correlation detection for multi-agent anomalies |  |  |
| Risk tier selective elevation reducing compute >25% |  |  |
| Immutable audit w/ verified Merkle segments |  |  |
| Fairness dashboard active w/ last 30d report |  |  |
| Quarantine system tested & documented |  |  |
| Replay harness for policy what-if analysis |  |  |
| Threshold tuning workflow defined |  |  |

Expansion blocked if any “No”.

---

## 15. Recommendations Summary

1. Treat 10 systems as a **stability milestone**, not a saturation limit.  
2. Invest early in **schema stability** and **policy signing**—retrofits get expensive.  
3. Build **risk-adaptive evaluation** to cap cost growth linearly with volume.  
4. Anchor integrity (Merkle) before external stakeholders demand it.  
5. Stand up **fairness & ethics tooling** before metrics become noisy at scale.  
6. Keep “Future 50” horizons explicit: region tagging, pluggable detectors, formal DSL, privacy primitives.  

---

## 16. Optional Next Deliverables I Can Generate

- Policy JSON schema + signing example  
- Merkle anchoring Python module skeleton  
- Correlation sliding window pseudocode  
- Risk scoring configuration template  
- Terraform/Kubernetes baseline for multi-system deployment  

Let me know which ones you’d like next and I’ll draft them.
