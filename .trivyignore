# Trivy Ignore Patterns
# 
# This file configures Trivy to skip scanning specific files or patterns
# that are known to produce false positives or are not part of our codebase.

# Ignore JWT examples in PyJWT library documentation
# This is not our code - it's the library's own example documentation
# The string "secret" appears in PyJWT's METADATA file as an example,
# not as an actual secret in our codebase.
