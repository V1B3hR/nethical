# RiskEngine Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the RiskEngine module into `train_any_model.py`, allowing real-time risk tracking during model training.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Integration (`training/train_any_model.py`)
- Added RiskEngine import with availability check
- Added two new command-line arguments:
  - `--enable-risk-tracking`: Enable risk tracking
  - `--risk-decay-hours`: Configure risk score decay half-life (default: 24.0 hours)
- Initialize RiskEngine when risk tracking is enabled
- Track risk during validation based on metrics (ECE and accuracy)
- Track promotion gate failures as high-severity risk events (0.8 severity)
- Display comprehensive risk profile summary at end of training
- Integrate with Merkle audit trail when audit logging is enabled

### 2. Risk Calculation Logic
Risk violation severity is calculated from:
- **Calibration Error (ECE)**: Normalized to [0,1], severe if > 0.25
- **Accuracy**: Low accuracy (< 0.85) increases risk
- **Promotion Gate Failure**: 0.8 severity for failed promotion

Risk score combines four components with weighted fusion:
- 30% Behavior Score (violation rate)
- 30% Severity Score (violation severity)
- 20% Frequency Score (recent violations)
- 20% Recency Score (time since last violation)

### 3. Risk Tiers
- **LOW** (0.0 - 0.25): Normal operation
- **NORMAL** (0.25 - 0.50): Acceptable but monitor
- **HIGH** (0.50 - 0.75): Concerning, needs attention
- **ELEVATED** (0.75+): Critical, trigger advanced detectors

### 4. Test Suite (`tests/test_train_risk_tracking.py`)
Created 6 comprehensive tests:
1. `test_train_with_risk_tracking`: Basic risk tracking functionality
2. `test_train_with_risk_and_audit`: Risk tracking + audit logging integration
3. `test_train_with_all_features`: Risk + audit + drift tracking together
4. `test_train_without_risk_tracking`: Baseline test without risk tracking
5. `test_risk_tracking_elevated_tier`: Elevated tier detection on promotion failure
6. `test_risk_decay_parameter`: Custom decay parameter configuration

All tests pass successfully with pytest.

### 5. Documentation (`RISK_TRACKING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`)
Created comprehensive quick reference guide including:
- What is risk tracking
- Quick start examples
- Command-line options
- Risk tiers and calculation
- Use cases and best practices
- Integration with other features
- Troubleshooting guide

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python training/train_any_model.py --model-type heuristic --enable-risk-tracking
```

### With Custom Decay
```bash
python training/train_any_model.py --model-type logistic \
  --enable-risk-tracking \
  --risk-decay-hours 12.0
```

### Full Feature Integration
```bash
python training/train_any_model.py --model-type logistic \
  --enable-risk-tracking \
  --enable-audit \
  --enable-drift-tracking
```

## Integration with Existing Features

### Merkle Audit Trail
When both risk tracking and audit logging are enabled, the final risk profile is automatically logged to the audit trail as a `risk_profile_final` event:
```json
{
  "event_type": "risk_profile_final",
  "agent_id": "model_heuristic",
  "risk_profile": {
    "agent_id": "model_heuristic",
    "current_score": 0.5852,
    "current_tier": "high",
    "violation_count": 2,
    "total_actions": 2,
    "behavior_score": 1.0,
    "severity_score": 0.8,
    "frequency_score": 0.0,
    "recency_score": 1.0,
    "tier_history": [["2025-10-07T12:22:07.775953", "high"]]
  }
}
```

### Ethical Drift Tracking
Works seamlessly with drift tracking to provide comprehensive training governance.

## Testing Results
- ✅ All 6 new risk tracking tests pass
- ✅ All 7 existing phase3 risk engine tests pass
- ✅ Integration tested with all model types (heuristic, logistic, anomaly, correlation)
- ✅ Validated with combined features (risk + audit + drift)

## Benefits

1. **Early Detection**: Identify problematic models during training
2. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Multi-factor risk assessment
3. **Audit Trail**: Permanent record of risk profiles when audit enabled
4. **Flexible Configuration**: Adjustable decay parameters
5. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing features (audit, drift)
6. **Minimal Overhead**: Efficient in-memory tracking
