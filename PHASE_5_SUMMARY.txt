OVERVIEW
--------
Phase 5: Detection Omniscience successfully adds predictive threat detection
with formal verification capabilities to Nethical.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
----------------

1. THREAT INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION (13KB)
   ✅ Multi-source aggregation (7 threat sources)
   ✅ Automatic deduplication and correlation
   ✅ Real-time alerting with 90-day retention
   ✅ Advanced search and filtering

2. PREDICTIVE MODELING (15.8KB)
   ✅ ML-based attack prediction (3 time horizons: 7, 30, 90 days)
   ✅ Trend analysis (5 trend types)
   ✅ Attack evolution modeling with mutation rates
   ✅ Prediction validation and accuracy tracking

3. PROACTIVE HARDENING (18.9KB)
   ✅ Automatic defense deployment
   ✅ 5 priority levels with human approval workflows
