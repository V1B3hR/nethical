## Architecture Highlights

### Global Topology

```
20 Regional Deployments
├── Tier 1 (6 regions × 5 instances) = 30 instances, 75,000 peak RPS
├── Tier 2 (8 regions × 3 instances) = 24 instances, 36,000 peak RPS
└── Tier 3 (6 regions × 2 instances) = 12 instances, 12,000 peak RPS

Total: 66 instances, 123,000+ peak RPS capacity
```

### Storage Strategy

```
1B Actions Storage
├── Hot Tier (7 days): 6M actions, 12 GB uncompressed
├── Warm Tier (90 days): 72M actions, 48 GB compressed (3:1)
├── Cold Tier (365 days): 250M actions, 100 GB compressed (5:1)
├── Archive (1-7 years): 1.5B actions, 300 GB compressed (10:1)
└── Deep Archive (7+ years): 10B+ actions, 1.3+ TB compressed (15:1)

Total for 1B actions: ~400 GB compressed across all tiers
```

### Auto-Scaling Configuration

- **Scale-up triggers**: CPU > 70%, latency p95 > 250ms, queue depth > 100
- **Scale-down triggers**: CPU < 30% for 15 minutes
- **Scaling limits**: 1-5 instances per tier 1 region, 1-3 tier 2, 1-2 tier 3
