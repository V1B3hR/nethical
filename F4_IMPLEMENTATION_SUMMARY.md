## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity
- Bayesian optimization: O(nÂ²) where n = iterations
- Adaptive tuning: O(1) per outcome
- A/B testing: O(1) per metric update
- Statistical tests: O(1) computation

### Storage Requirements
- Outcomes: ~200 bytes per record
- Configurations: ~500 bytes per config
- A/B Tests: ~1KB per test
- Agent Profiles: ~300 bytes per agent

### Scalability
- Supports 1000+ agent profiles
- Handles concurrent A/B tests
- Efficient SQLite storage
- Automatic cleanup of old data

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Bayesian Optimization**: Implemented simplified Gaussian process approach instead of full GP to reduce complexity while maintaining effectiveness

2. **Statistical Testing**: Used z-test for proportions which is appropriate for large samples and computationally efficient

3. **Storage**: SQLite for small-medium deployments, easily upgradable to PostgreSQL for scale

4. **Learning Rate**: Default 0.01 provides good balance between responsiveness and stability

5. **Outcome Categories**: Support both generic ("correct") and specific ("true_positive", "false_positive") outcome types for flexibility

## Integration Points

F4 integrates seamlessly with:
- Phase 8: Human feedback â†’ adaptive tuning
- Phase 9: Optimization techniques extended with Bayesian
- IntegratedGovernance: Can be used through main governance API
- Phase89IntegratedGovernance: Direct integration for human-in-loop workflows

## Example Usage

```python
from nethical.core import Phase89IntegratedGovernance

gov = Phase89IntegratedGovernance(storage_dir="./data")

# Bayesian optimization
results = gov.optimize_configuration(technique="bayesian")

# Record outcomes
gov.record_outcome("act_1", "judg_1", "block", "false_positive", 0.8)

# Agent-specific thresholds
gov.set_agent_thresholds("agent_1", {'classifier_threshold': 0.6})

# A/B testing
control_id, treatment_id = gov.create_ab_test(cfg1, cfg2, traffic_split=0.1)
```
